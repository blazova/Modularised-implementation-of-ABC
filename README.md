A repository dedicated to practicing Python in systems (modularised code) and advanced OOP

Here's what we did in this lesson:

 - Learned how to create Python modules
 - Expanded our understanding of OOP to include abstraction and inheritance
 - Practiced critical design patterns for larger code bases
 
 Running the program: `python pets.py`
